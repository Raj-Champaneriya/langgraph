User: Great, I want to teach you new language. How can I do it?
AI: That's great to hear that you'd like to help me learn a new language! There are several ways we can work together to improve my language skills:

1. **Conversational practice**: We can have a conversation in the language you'd like to teach me. You can ask me questions, and I'll respond with my best attempt at speaking the language.
2. **Language lessons**: If you're familiar with the language, we can go through a series of lessons covering grammar, vocabulary, and pronunciation. I can provide you with exercises and activities to help reinforce your learning.
3. **Vocabulary building**: We can focus on adding new words and phrases to my vocabulary. You can teach me new words, and I'll try to use them in context.
4. **Pronunciation practice**: If you're familiar with the language's pronunciation, we can practice speaking together. This will help me improve my ability to produce native-like sounds and intonation.
